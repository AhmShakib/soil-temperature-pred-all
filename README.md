# SoilTemperaturePred

This repository contains an implementation for predicting soil temperature using machine learning methods. The project includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization tools.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning utilities.
- Multiple machine learning models for soil temperature prediction.
- Training, validation, and testing workflows.
- Visualization of results and performance metrics.
- Example notebooks for step-by-step demonstrations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- keras

You can install all required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmShakib/soil-temperature-pred-all.git
   cd soil-temperature-pred-all
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your data:**
   Place your soil temperature dataset in the `data/` directory.

4. **Train a model:**
   Run the main training script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate results:**
   Output metrics and visualizations will be saved in the `results/` directory.
